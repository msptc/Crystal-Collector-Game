This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers. Four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
A random number will be displayed at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The game is won if the player's total score matches the random number. The game is lost if the player's total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked. The number of games won and lost will be displayed.

If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number will receive 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player will receive 1 loss. Regardless of a win or loss, the game restarts.

When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
